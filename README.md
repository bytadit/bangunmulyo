### Overview
**Bangun Mulyo** is a web-based application developed by me as my own program in "Kuliah Kerja Nyata (KKN)", to support the administration, treasury, and inventory activities at the Village-Owned Enterprise (BUMDes) "Bangun Mulyo." The application aims to replace the manual processes previously done on paper, enabling all activities to be carried out more easily, quickly, and efficiently.
